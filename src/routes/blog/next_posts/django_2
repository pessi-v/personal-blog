		A couple of things to note here: Firstly, sorting in descending order is used by adding a dash
		'-' in front of the attribute we're sorting by. Secondly, we'll pass the request to the render()

			- for the current user object request.user
			- User authentication status
			- Session data
			- Cookies
			- GET/POST parameters
			- CSRF token for forms
			- Debug information (when DEBUG=True)
			- Add security headers
Process sessions
Handle user authentication
Manage language preferences
